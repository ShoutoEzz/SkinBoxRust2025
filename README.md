SkinBox is a Rust plugin that allows players to change the appearance (skin) of their items through a simple and intuitive interface. It pulls available skins from the Steam Workshop and lets players apply them instantly without losing item stats or durability.

This plugin enhances player customization by making it easy to browse and apply skins to items in their inventory, workbench, or storage.
